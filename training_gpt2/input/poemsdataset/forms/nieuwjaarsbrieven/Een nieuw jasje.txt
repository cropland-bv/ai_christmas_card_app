dearest aunt,
do you know what happened?
it was in all the newspapers
they've given it a new look
Something for everyone that fits
The new year is ready
And it's waiting for your arrival
It asks you to come quickly
because there's still a tie to go!
Everyone puts in whatever they want
You know what I put in yours?
a pink sunglasses: look at the year rose
a red rose: for the passion and love
a jar of glitter: for the happiness that cannot be missed
a tiny little card that says: big kisses for 365 days
a little gift card containing: a tiny little cat for when you're lonely
but you know what else?
there are a thousand and two wishes inside that you can fulfill
The first one I'm going to wish: I wish for you the most wonderful year!
Now there are a thousand and one wishes and my letter is ready!
Big kisses from your sweetheart
