A new year begins,
and here I am, your dear child.
I wish you again now,
just like last time,
a happy year, not too busy,
good health and
much happiness!
I thank you for the many cares,
those of yesterday and those of tomorrow.
I promise to live as I should.
I will be very good, is it all right?
Yes, dearest, 'tis really true:
It will surely be a wonderful year!
