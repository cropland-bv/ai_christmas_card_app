The new year is upon us
And stares kindly at me.
It doesn't know yet if it will come in
Or outside but remains standing.
And when the clock has struck the final stroke of twelve.
Then I throw open the doors wide For these new days.
I give to you a package of wishes,
Not big or lavishly expensive,
But with what you wish for yourself.
I thank you for letting me know you in the old year
And wish you a good new year,
with lots of friendship and good health.
Your dear troublemaker Marina
