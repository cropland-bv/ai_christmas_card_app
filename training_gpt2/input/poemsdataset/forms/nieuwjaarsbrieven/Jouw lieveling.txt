I know I'm your darling,
you like to call me: my darling.
Even though I am almost twelve years old.
Know that I find you
very special.
I can always go to you.
You always make a sea of time for me
and everything I am teased with,
I can always say to you.
Dear godmother, stay a long time
my sun, my star, my moon!
Because of you I become less afraid
to go my own way.
