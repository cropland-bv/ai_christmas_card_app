Dear big people,
I have a child's heart full of wishes
For I love life
But what I want to ask you
In my short New Year's letter
Is simply that every day
a little more care for each other
because I want to be happy
will you set an example for me
and teach me how to live
please do something about it
because I want to go your way
Children should always
promise to be good
and good and sweet
make us believe in man
in what he does
Only then will the future have value
And life here on earth
When I become great man, good
From your little troublemaker
