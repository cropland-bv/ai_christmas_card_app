In the New Year, never forget to thank your past years, because they enabled you to reach today! Without the stairs of the past, you cannot arrive at the future!
Youth is when you're allowed to stay up late on New Year's Eve. Middle age is when you're forced to.
Happy New Year! Here's to living life to the full in 2023. As a wise person once said, "You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough!"
Happy New Year! May your day start with a smile and end with champagne. Cheers!
Wishing you and your family a happy new year filled with hope, health, and happiness - with a generous sprinkle of fun!
As the sun sets on another year, I wish you great company and good cheer.
Wishing you a blessed New Year! When I count my blessings, I count you twice.
As 2023 approaches, I realize how lucky I am to count you as my friend. I am truly grateful for all that you do. My New Year's resolution is to make more time to catch up with you next year, no matter how crazy work and life gets.
As the new year dawns, I hope it gets filled with the promises of a brighter tomorrow. Happy New Year!
Wishing you and your family a year brimming with good eats, good drinks, and lots of good adventures!
Happy New Year! Although we may be far apart, you are always in my heart.
Each year is a gift that holds hope for new adventures. May your New Year be filled with exploration, discovery, and growth.
Happy New Year! Wishing you lots of love and laughter in 2023 and success in reaching your goals!
Happy New Year! Best wishes to my beloved friend for a wonderful year ahead. Though we're miles apart, you are always in my thoughts and prayers.
Happy New Year! I know this past year has had its fair share of ups and downs - but good or bad, these experiences have shaped who we are today and who we will be in the future. Onwards and upwards my friend, with no regrets!
Happy New Year! Although we are miles apart this time, I'll be celebrating with you in spirit.
Happy New Year! I hope next year brings us more wonderful opportunities to spend time together.
Happy New Year! May you find the perspective you seek in 2023. As a wise person once said, "Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain". This is the perfect time to turn over a new leaf and follow your dreams. You can do it!
Happy New Year! Thank you for everything you do for me. You're a great friend!
Don't ever feel like your best days are behind you. Reinvention is the purest form of hope. Make today your best yet!
Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames.
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.
Wishing you 12 months of success, 52 weeks of laughter, 365 days of fun, 8760 hours of joy, 525600 minutes of good luck, and 31536000 seconds of happiness. Happy New Year!
Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.
Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!"
Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
As we look forward to the new year, let's resolve to recommit ourselves to the values we share.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
It's never too late - never too late to start over, never too late to be happy.
A new year. A fresh, clean start! It's like having a big white sheet of paper to draw on! A day full of possibilities!
Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.
In the New Year, never forget to thank your past years because they enabled you to reach today! Without the stairs of the past, you cannot arrive at the future!
Be at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every New Year find you a better person.
We spend January 1 walking through our lives, room by room, drawing up a list of work to be done, cracks to be patched. Maybe this year, to balance the list, we ought to walk through the rooms of our lives, not looking for flaws, but for potential.
And now we welcome the new year. Full of things that have never been.
Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.
Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come,
Whispering "it will be happier".
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the first blank page of a 365-page book. Write a good one!
You can't go back and make a new start, but you can start right now and make a brand-new ending.
Life is a great big canvas, and you should throw all the paint on it you can.
Happy New Year! Here's to living life to the full in 2023. As a wise person once said, "You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough!"
Happy New Year! May your day start with a smile and end with champagne. Cheers!
Wishing you and your family a happy new year filled with hope, health, and happiness - with a generous sprinkle of fun!

Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames.
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.
One day you will wake up and there won't be any more time to do the things you've always wanted. Do it now.
There comes a day when you realize turning the page is the best feeling in the world, because you realize there's so much more to the book than the page you were stuck on.
Pour the champagne and let its mousse rise, like thousands of sparkling smiling eyes.
Tomorrow is a new day. Begin it well and serenely, with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.
The New Year stands before us, like a chapter in a book, waiting to be written.
Live it up on New Year's Eve - you've got the whole year to live it down!
Happy New Year! Don't forget to make a new year's resolution you won't keep.
Remember when we were younger and just wanted to stay up on New Year's Eve? Now all we want to do is sleep!
An optimist stays up until midnight to see the New Year in. A pessimist stays up to make sure the old year leaves.
New Year's Eve, where auld acquaintance be forgot. Unless, of course, those tests come back positive.
Before I get drunk, dance on the bar, lose my phone, get naked and get arrested, let me wish you a Happy New Year!
May all of your troubles last as long as my New Year's resolutions! Happy New Year!
Happy New Year! Let's eat, drink, and be merry - for tomorrow we diet!
Wise, kind, gentle, generous, sexy. But enough about me, here's to you - Happy New Year!
Happy New Year! Here's to living on the edge a little more in 2023. As Hunter S. Thompson said: "Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, 'Wow! What a Ride!'"
Happy New Year! I don't know about you, but my New Year's resolution is to stop feeling guilty about not keeping last year's resolution.
My New Year's resolution was going to be to quit all my bad habits, but then it occurred to me - no one likes a quitter. Happy New Year!
A New Year's resolution is something that goes in one year and out the other.
Happy New Year! I can't believe another year has passed so quickly. In the words of Michael Altshuler, "The bad news is time flies. The good news is you're the pilot!"
Many years ago I resolved never to bother with New Year's resolutions, and I've stuck with it ever since.
A new year. A fresh, clean start! It's like having a big white sheet of paper to draw on! A day full of possibilities!
Youth is when you're allowed to stay up late on New Year's Eve. Middle age is when you're forced to.

I can't believe it's that time of year again! Time sure flies when we're having fun! I am so lucky to have shared it with you. Happy New Year!
Happy New Year my love! Thanks for accepting me for the complicated little oddball I am. When I'm with you, I feel I can totally be myself, and I hope you feel the same way too. Let us toast to another year of laughter and love.
Happy New Year, my love! Here's to new adventures, taking risks, not sweating the small stuff, and creating more beautiful memories together.

My fondest memories of the past year are the ones that include you!
Happy New Year my love! I'm so happy to be with you and spend this moment together.
My dreams came true when I met you. Looking forward to spending this New Year (and many more) together!
Happy New Year! As we prepare to farewell 2022, a year filled with more love, growth and understanding than I could have hoped for, I'm so excited to see what 2023 will hold for us. With you in my corner, I feel I can do anything. I am so lucky to have you.
Happy New Year my love! When I'm with you I feel like I can achieve anything. I love you to the moon and back!
The thought of sharing a brand-new year with you fills my heart with joy!
Ah, New Year's Eve. The evening of little miracles. Take away the dazzling fireworks, the celebrations, the drinking and the countdowns and what you are left with is hope. Small human hope. The hope of better days, of fresh starts, and perhaps, if you are very lucky, a kiss.
The proper behavior all through the holiday season is to be drunk. This drunkenness culminates on New Year's Eve, when you get so drunk you kiss the person you're married to.
May joy and peace surround you,
contentment latch your door,
and happiness be with you now
and bless you evermore!
May there always be work for your hands to do;
May your purse always hold a coin or two;
May the sun always shine on your windowpane;
May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain;
May the hand of a friend always be near you;
May God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.
Wishing you a blessed New Year! When I count my blessings, I count you twice.
May God shower you and your family with love and happiness! Best wishes and season's greetings for the New Year.
Wishing you a blessed and prosperous New Year!
May God bless you and your loved ones with prosperity, good health, and happiness in the New Year.
This New Year, may God answer your prayers and fulfill your heart's desires.
Happy New Year! May your troubles be less, and your blessings be more, and nothing but happiness come through your door!
May the road rise to meet you,
May the wind be ever at your back.
May the sun shine warm upon your face,
and the rains fall soft upon your fields.
And until we meet again,
May God hold you in the palm of His hand.
Every day I feel is a blessing from God. And I consider it a new beginning. Everything is beautiful.
Lord, I have no idea what's going to happen in this New Year. I pray that you will guide me. Please help me to look to you always, and through everything that I do, may I bring praise and glory to Your name. I thank you, Lord, for another year. Amen.
The object of a new year is not that we should have a new year. It is that we should have a new soul.
Look not back on yesterday
So full of failure and regret;
Look ahead and seek God's way -
All sin confessed you must forget.
In His wisdom God does not show us all that lies ahead. So we enter a new year to live it day by day. Each day let us follow more faithfully, more courageously, more daringly the lead of our great Captain who bids us follow Him.
Resolve to make each day the beginning of a new year, a new morning, a new adventure. Enjoy the blessings of a new year, in Christ, one day at a time!
Wishing you a Happy New Year and blessed year ahead. May God's light guide your way in 2023.
The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face shine on you and be gracious to you; the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace.
May He give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.
I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.
In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps.
Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this.
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy.
Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers, and blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD.
Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.
Stir the eggnog. Lift the toddy.
Happy New Year, everybody!
Ring out the old, ring in the new,
Ring, happy bells, across the snow:
The year is going, let him go;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Another fresh new year is here
Another year to live!
To banish worry, doubt, and fear,
To love and laugh and give!
Here's to the bright New Year
And a fond farewell to the old;
Here's to the things that are yet to come
And to the memories that we hold.
Let us have wine and women
Mirth and laughter
Sermons and soda-water
The day after.
Congratulations! Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself any direction you choose.
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
And old lang syne!
For old lang syne, my dear,
For old lang syne.
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
For old lang syne.
Tonight's December thirty-first,
Something is about to burst...
Hark, it's midnight, children dear.
Duck! Here comes another year!
