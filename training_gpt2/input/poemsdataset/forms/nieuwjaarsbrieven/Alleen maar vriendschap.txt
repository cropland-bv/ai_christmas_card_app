Dear Aunt,
Do you remember very clearly
That first day of last year?
When I also offered my wishes
And had to stand in the middle of the room.
They were wishes of prosperity and happiness,
it couldn't go wrong!
Laughter, jumping, dancing and lots of fun,
That's why you're here again this year.
Together with you I want to start
And we'll let in only friendship.
No fighting or violence, We'll work on that
So that all the world can notice!
And at the start of the next year
Will we come together again.
With another wish in a new letter.
Different, perhaps, but just as sweet!
I wish for you a happy year,
But unfortunately my bill is finished now.
Big kisses from your goddaughter,
