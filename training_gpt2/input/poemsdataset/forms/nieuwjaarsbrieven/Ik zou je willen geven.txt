Dearest mom and dad,
I would like to give you a very cozy life,
a bag of a hundred pennies
a loaf of bread with a thousand currants,
a field of daisies
a cart with sweethearts,
a garden with golden gates
a book full of sweet words,
a cake like a castle
a dress of green velvet,
a big soft white rabbit
a barrel full of French wine,
a hat with a feather
and in 2006 many, many more
happy new year !!!
