Around this time of year
Many stand with their bills ready.
And everything that money can buy
is summed up for you in a wish.
But I wish you no diamonds
No wealth or fortune.
I wish for you seven rainbows
As a bridge between desire and fulfillment.
I wish for you as many fine things
As there are stars in the sky in freezing weather.
I wish for you a bellowing storm, very occasionally,
to chase crazy dreams through your head.
I wish for you warm sunshine,
on the faces of those you love.
I wish you a little mist, too,
to cover some sadness.
