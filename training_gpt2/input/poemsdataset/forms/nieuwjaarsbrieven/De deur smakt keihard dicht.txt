So quickly another year has passed.
Were you satisfied, sad or happy?
The door of 2006 is slamming shut,
Through a crack of 2007 new light now falls.
I wish you joy, health, no fretting,
No moaning and whining, that makes you so tired.
The old is over, a new year begins.
Maybe you got hard nuts to crack,
Hopefully many sunny days to come.
For the next year I wish you many friends
With cheery faces and happy smiles!
