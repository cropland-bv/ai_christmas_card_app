Dearest ...
Around this time of year,
many stand at the ready with their bills.
They wish this, they wish that,
each one gets a special gift.
But I wish you no diamonds,
not wealth, riches or fortune.
I wish for you no Wendy Van Wanten,
no Helmut Lotti or Andre Van Duin.
I wish you 7 rainbows,
that will dry all your tears.
I wish for you so many nice things,
that you can laugh, dance and sing all the time.
I wish you the most beautiful dreams,
where elves, butterflies and angels come.
I wish for you a warm ray of sunshine,
I wish you that most of all.
But I see you thinking,
I'm not quite finished.
Because what I have yet to grant you,
is a happy New Year!
From your ...
