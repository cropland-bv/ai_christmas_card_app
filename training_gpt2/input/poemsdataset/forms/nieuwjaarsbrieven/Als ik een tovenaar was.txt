Now if I were a magician,
I'd do the most wonderful things:
I would make all your dreams come true,
you would sing for joy!
You would be happy this year,
it would indeed be a giant party!
But oh I am not a magician,
I never was.
Therefore I can only wish:
happiness,health most of all.
I wish it to you and all the people
who make the world a party.
At school I will do my best
And be a sunshine at home.
I promise with a big kiss.
Don't you like that very much?
