Cold days full of warm words.
When cold branches feed the world.
And long nights guard the day
Before seven seas perish in crystal.
And white winter fairies silently sing over the stable.
Where the end shall meet the beginning.
When warm fires ignite in cold hours.
And tender second last forever.
Before young greenery colors the earth.
And frozen hearts thaw in turn.
Where life laments death.
There and then today and here I tell you,....
In long nights during cold hours.
When darkness and silence endure endlessly.
Then listen to the winter fairies.
Who sing with my voice and say dearest ....
I'm glad I know you !
