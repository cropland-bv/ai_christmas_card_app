I've been thinking for a while now
What I could give you
This time I want to give you something special
Which you will enjoy a lot
It's not a big present
But still I will make you very happy
To put your mind at rest
I will tell you this
I'm sure I'll manage
I'll be fun and sweet all year
Oh, you'll see next year
When I come to play you won't hear me ...maybe
I'll catch a cold or a little sick
Then you'll listen to my sadness
I love coming home to you
And then hang out in front of the tube
That's why I wish you with a big gesture
A very sincere and Happy New Year
I'm gonna be a cool super champion
Well... I give you a big kiss.
