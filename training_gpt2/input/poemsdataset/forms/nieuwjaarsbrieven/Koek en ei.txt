actually the world is a strange place
this year there was a lot of weeping
war disasters and so on
do you think this is the way it should be
Everyone should contribute
no more bullying just teasing
Take an example from us
Between us it was always cake and egg
Of course things weren't always the way they should be
sometimes very crazy just crazy
But the past is done, over
Now there's a future for you and me
because the new year begins, and next year again
I wonder what it will bring
