The new year is coming
The old year is over
How quickly it has gone
Another one of those uphill years
I hope all my wishes
Of last year for all the people
have had their impact
and the world-wide carnage
has been transformed a little more
into a world peace bubble bath
now the new year has begun
And even though I wish this year similarly
Yet for you specially I wish
Carrying this wish without grumbling
Cause I like you so much
Now I'm about ready
And I wish you
A happy New Year!
