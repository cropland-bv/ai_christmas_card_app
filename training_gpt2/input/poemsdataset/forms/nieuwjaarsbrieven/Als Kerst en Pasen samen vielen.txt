If Christmas and Easter fell together
Would we kneel before the Easter bunny
Hanging eggs in the Christmas tree
And receive lots of presents at Easter
Fortunately, none of this is true
Merry Christmas and a happy new year
The very best wishes for 200x
May each new day
May give you peace
And mountains of happiness
A whole year in 1 piece
Full of love for each other
An incredibly good year!
