The Christmas tree is lit
I see your happy face
It's beautifully decorated here
There is a celebration
Today I am very happy
Because there is a present for me
I am still a little person
With a very big wish
That each new day
May give you much joy
And mountains of happiness
A whole year in one piece
We wish each other
A very happy New Year!
