Do you remember very clearly
That first day of last year?
When I also offered my wishes
And had to stand in the middle of the room.
They were wishes of prosperity and happiness
For a new century, it couldn't fail!
But not much came of my wishes
Because look how it is in real life.
New York, Afganistan, Israel, all that violence.
On television and in the newspapers they tell about it.
And all that scares me so much
Because it's been going on for so long now.
Yet again I stand ready with my new wishes
To wish you only much peace.
Peace and much love here at home
But also at your work and on the tube.
Together with you I want to start.
We only let in friendship.
No arguments or violence, we will work on that.
So that everyone can notice it.
And at the start of the next year
We'll come together again
With another wish in a new letter.
Different, perhaps, but just as sweet.
