Dear Grandma and Grandpa,
At the beginning of the new year,
I have another bill ready...
Oh, no! What an old-fashioned beginning,
I prefer a modern phrase.
Something like:
Grandmas at the top, partying can't stop.
Oh, I forgot,
you're not a fan of K3,
you prefer Helmut Lotti!
I'll have to think of something else
to start my letter with.
How about: Dear Grandpa, I love you,
isn't that a good start to a letter?
With these sweet little words I'll write 100 bills full.
If you have to read them all, you'll probably go crazy.
That's why I keep it simple, without much bazaar.
I wish you, dear grandma and grandpa
a super perfect year
your troublemaker,
