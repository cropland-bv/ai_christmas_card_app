Here I am with my New Year's letter.
Don't you think that's sweet?
It's all going so fast anyway.
And we can't go back!
That's why I wrote this letter
Because I am your heart's desire.
I wish you many more years
Without complaining and mourning.
Congratulations on your retirement
I'll give you a big kiss
